## Starting Guide

1. Clone the project
2. run `docker-compose up`
3. There you go!!

After the project fully started, access the app at _http://localhost:3000_

## Tech Stacks

The projects are built with following stacks

- Express js
- Mysql
- sequalize ORM
- React (Next.js)
- Docker compose

## Note

The project are FARRRRR from perfect. There are still plenty of rooms to improve in the projects such as

- global exception handling,
- using kafka for event driven design and making sure the DB transaction is atomic.
- writing unit test
- use K8

Regret that i didn't optimize the project enough to the point i want due to my tight schedule as it is almost year end. Together with the time needed to refresh most of the skills like docker, react, sequalize, etc., one week is a bit tight. :)
